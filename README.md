1. What is Hibernate?
Hibernate is an open-source Java-based ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables, and vice versa.

2. What are the benefits of using Hibernate?
Some benefits of using Hibernate are:
   - Simplifies database access and reduces boilerplate code.
   - Provides a higher level of abstraction, making the code more maintainable.
   - Offers transparent persistence, allowing you to focus on business logic rather than SQL queries.
   - Supports caching and improves application performance.
   - Database independence - you can switch between different databases without changing your code.

3. Explain the concept of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
ORM is a programming technique that allows developers to map object-oriented domain models to relational database tables. It bridges the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases.

4. What is a Session in Hibernate?
A Session in Hibernate represents a single-threaded unit of work that maintains a connection with the database. It provides methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on persistent objects.

5. What is a SessionFactory in Hibernate?
A SessionFactory is a factory class that creates and manages Session instances. It is a heavyweight object, typically created once during the application's startup, and shared among all the threads.

6. How do you configure Hibernate?
Hibernate can be configured using either XML-based configuration or annotations. XML-based configuration is done through `hibernate.cfg.xml`, and annotation-based configuration uses annotations on entities.

7. What is the use of the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file?
The `hibernate.cfg.xml` file is the configuration file in Hibernate that contains database connection details, mapping information, and other configuration properties.

8. How do you map Java objects to database tables in Hibernate?
Java objects are mapped to database tables using annotations or XML-based configuration. Annotations like `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@Column`, etc., are used to specify the mapping.

9. Explain the `@Entity` annotation in Hibernate.
The `@Entity` annotation is used to mark a Java class as an entity, which means it will be mapped to a database table. Each entity instance represents a row in the table.

10. What is the use of the `@Id` annotation in Hibernate?
The `@Id` annotation is used to mark a field as the primary key of the entity. It uniquely identifies each row in the database table.

11. What is the difference between `save()` and `persist()` methods in Hibernate?
Both `save()` and `persist()` methods are used to persist objects in the database, but there is a subtle difference. `save()` returns the generated identifier immediately, whereas `persist()` doesn't guarantee immediate execution of the SQL INSERT.

12. What is the difference between `openSession()` and `getCurrentSession()` methods in Hibernate?
`openSession()` method creates a new Session every time it is called, whereas `getCurrentSession()` returns the current Session associated with the current transaction or creates a new one if none exists.

13. How do you retrieve data from the database using Hibernate?
You can retrieve data using HQL (Hibernate Query Language), Criteria API, or native SQL queries.

14. What is the HQL (Hibernate Query Language)?
HQL is an object-oriented query language provided by Hibernate, similar to SQL, but it operates on Java objects and their properties.

15. How do you execute native SQL queries in Hibernate?
You can execute native SQL queries in Hibernate using the `createNativeQuery()` method of the `Session` object.

16. What is the Criteria API in Hibernate?
The Criteria API in Hibernate allows you to build queries programmatically using Java code rather than writing HQL or native SQL queries.

17. Explain the FetchType in Hibernate.
FetchType is an enumeration that defines how Hibernate should fetch related entities or collections when loading an entity. It can be `EAGER` (load immediately) or `LAZY` (load on demand).

18. What are the different types of associations in Hibernate?
Hibernate supports four types of associations: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many.

19. How do you implement a One-to-One association in Hibernate?
One-to-One association can be implemented using `@OneToOne` annotation, specifying the associated entity and the join column.

24. What is the `@JoinColumn` annotation used for in Hibernate?
The `@JoinColumn` annotation is used to specify the column that is used for joining an entity with its associated entity in a database table.

29. How do you implement inheritance in Hibernate?
Hibernate supports three types of inheritance: Single Table, Joined Table, and Table per Class Hierarchy.

30. What is the `@MappedSuperclass` annotation used for in Hibernate?
The `@MappedSuperclass` annotation is used to mark a class as a superclass whose properties should be inherited by its subclasses. However, it is not an entity itself, so it won't be mapped to a database table.

31. How do you implement optimistic locking in Hibernate?
Optimistic locking in Hibernate can be achieved using the `@Version` annotation on a field, representing the version number of the entity.

32. What is a Hibernate Proxy, and how does it work?
A Hibernate Proxy is a placeholder object that stands in for the actual entity until it is accessed. When the entity is accessed for the first time, Hibernate loads it from the database.

33. What is the use of the `@NamedQuery` annotation in Hibernate?
The `@NamedQuery` annotation is used to define named queries in Hibernate, which are pre-defined queries that can be reused across the application.

34. What is a Second-Level Cache in Hibernate?


Second-Level Cache is a shared cache that stores objects that are frequently accessed, allowing Hibernate to avoid repeated database queries.

35. How do you enable Second-Level Cache in Hibernate?
You can enable Second-Level Cache in Hibernate by configuring a cache provider and setting cache-related properties in the Hibernate configuration file.

36. What is the purpose of the `@Cacheable` annotation in Hibernate?
The `@Cacheable` annotation is used to mark an entity class as cacheable. When enabled, the entity's data will be stored in the Second-Level Cache.

45. How do you handle the N+1 issue in Hibernate?
The N+1 issue occurs when Hibernate generates N+1 SQL queries to fetch N entities and their associated entities. It can be solved by using the `JOIN FETCH` keyword in JPQL or HQL queries.
